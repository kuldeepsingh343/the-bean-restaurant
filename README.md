## 💡 Project Overview
The website was developed to help **The Bean Restaurant** improve visibility and attract more customers by showcasing their complete menu and allowing direct customer feedback.  

I gathered all the project requirements directly from the restaurant’s owner, created a prototype for initial approval, and then built the full version with iterative improvements.  
The project was **completed and launched successfully on October 2, 2025**.  

Originally hosted on **GitHub Pages**, it was later moved to **Netlify** for a shorter and more professional domain.
